# Trilinos Home Page

## Welcome to the Trilinos Project Home Page

The Trilinos Project is an effort to develop algorithms and enabling technologies within an object-oriented software framework 
for the solution of large-scale, complex multi-physics engineering and scientific problems. 
A unique design feature of Trilinos is its focus on packages.

## What Trilinos Can Do: Trilinos Capability Areas

[The Trilinos Capability Area homepage](capability-areas.html) organizes Trilinos capabilities into nine collections of functionality and describes 
which packages are relevant to each area. This discussion is especially useful for new Trilinos users.

## Trilinos is on GitHub

The [primary Trilinos repository](https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos) 
is now hosted on GitHub. This allows users and potential developers greater access to Trilinos source code.

## TUG 2017

The [2017 Trilinos User Group Meeting](https://trilinos.github.io/trilinos_user-developer_group_meeting_2017.html) (TUG) will be held in October in Albuquerque. 

## Trilinos 12.10 Release

Trilinos 12.10 is now available for [download](download.html). 
The 12.4 release uses a [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 
build system, which requires CMake version 2.8.11 or greater. 
Instructions for building Trilinos 10.0 and later are available 
[here](pdfs/Trilinos10.12Tutorial.pdf).

## Trilinos Packages

Each Trilinos package is a self-contained, independent piece of software with its own set of requirements, 
its own development team and group of users. Because of this, Trilinos itself is designed to respect the autonomy of packages. 
Trilinos offers a variety of ways for a particular package to interact with other Trilinos packages. 
It also offers a set of tools that can assist package developers with builds across multiple platforms, 
generating documentation and regression testing across a set of target platforms. 
At the same time, what a package must do to be called a Trilinos package is minimal, and varies with each package.
