This area features packages that offer modular, interoperable, and extensible tools, often build upon the capabilities provided by the Core and Solvers areas. These tools support the discretization of integral and differential equations, including both mesh-based approaches (e.g., finite element analysis), and meshless methods (e.g., generalized moving least squares).
