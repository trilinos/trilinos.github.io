Framework for solving large-scale eigenvalue problems, including methods such as block Davidson, Krylov-Schur, locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOBPCG), and trace minimization. These algorithms are designed to handle large, sparse matrices arising in scientific and engineering applications, providing flexibility and scalability for diverse use cases.
