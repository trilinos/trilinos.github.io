Comprehensive suite of iterative solvers for linear systems, including Krylov methods such as CG, GMRES, MINRES, and BiCGStab. These solvers support block and pseudo-block methods for solving systems with multiple right-hand sides, as well as advanced techniques like flexible GMRES and pipelined CG.
