Scalable multigrid solvers for a wide range of PDEs, including Poisson-like operators, elasticity, convection-diffusion, and Maxwell’s equations. These solvers include aggregation-based algebraic multigrid methods, semi-coarsening for structured grids, and specialized solvers for multiphysics problems.
