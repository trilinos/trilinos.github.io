Multilevel Schwarz preconditioners that emphasize scalability and robustness across challenging problems. These preconditioners support extension-based coarse spaces and are designed for algebraic construction, relying solely on the sparsity pattern of the system matrix. They have demonstrated scalability to hundreds of thousands of cores on supercomputers.
