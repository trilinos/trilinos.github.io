Overlapping additive Schwarz methods for preconditioning, with options for local subdomain solves such as incomplete LU factorizations and direct solvers. These methods accelerate iterative solvers and include classic iterative techniques like Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and Chebyshev iterations, optimized for shared-memory architectures.
