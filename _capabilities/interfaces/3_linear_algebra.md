Scalable infrastructure for distributed-memory computations, providing linear algebra objects such as sparse matrices, dense vectors, and graphs. Supports efficient parallel operations using MPI-based communication, including sparse matrix-vector multiplication, matrix-matrix multiplication, and graph-based operations. Features include data redistribution, halo exchange, and flexible templated objects for compatibility with diverse applications and architectures. Essential for large-scale simulations on leadership-class systems.
