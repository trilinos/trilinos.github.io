**Rapid Optimization Library (ROL)** is a C++ package for large-scale optimization. It is used for the solution of optimal design, optimal control and inverse problems in large-scale engineering applications. Other uses include mesh optimization and image processing.

ROL aims to combine flexibility, efficiency and robustness. Key features:

*   _Matrix-free application programming interfaces (APIs)_ —enable direct use of application data structures and memory spaces, linear solvers, nonlinear solvers and preconditioners.
*   _State-of-the-art algorithms_ for unconstrained optimization, constrained optimization and optimization under uncertainty —enable inexact and adaptive function evaluations and iterative linear system solves.
*   _Special APIs for simulation-based optimization_ —enable a streamlined embedding into engineering applications, rigorous implementation verification and efficient use.
*   _Modular interfaces throughout the optimization process_ —enable custom and user-defined algorithms, stopping criteria, hierarchies of algorithms, and selective use of a variety of tools and components.
