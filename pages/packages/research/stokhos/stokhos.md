Welcome to the Stokhos Home

Stokhos is a package for intrusive stochastic Galerkin uncertainty quantification methods. It provides methods for computing well-known intrusive stochastic Galerkin projections such as Polynomial Chaos and Generalized Polynomial Chaos, interfaces for forming the resulting nonlinear systems, and linear solver methods for solving block stochastic Galerkin linear systems.
