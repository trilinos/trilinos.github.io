Welcome to the Teko Home

_Teko means “fuse” in Greek. This is suggestive of what Teko does, bringing together multiple physics to form one preconditioner. Additionally, the original impetus for Teko was for the development of preconditioners for simulation of magnetohydrodynamics and fusion reactors._

Teko is a package for development and implementation of block preconditioners. This includes support for manipulation and setup of block operators. Furthermore tools exist to support decomposition of a fully coupled operator. Additionally, facilities that allow the construction of approximate inverse operators using the full complement of available preconditioners and solvers are available in Teko. Finally, a small number of generic block preconditioners has been implemented in Teko, including block Jacobi, and block Gauss-Seidel. For the Navier-Stokes equation, Teko has implementations of SIMPLE, PCD and LSC. 
For details on these methods see [Stabilization and Scalable Block Preconditioning for the Navier-Stokes Equations](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2011.09.001) and the references therein.
