**Welcome to the Phalanx Home**

Phalanx is a local field evaluation kernel specifically designed for general partial differential equation solvers. 
The main goal of Phalanx is to decompose a complex problem into a number of simpler problems with managed dependencies to support rapid development and extensibility of the PDE code. 
Through the use of template metaprogramming concepts, Phalanx supports arbitrary user defined data types and evaluation types. This allows for unprecedented flexibility for direct integration with user applications and 
provides extensive support for embedded technology such as automatic differentiation for sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification.
