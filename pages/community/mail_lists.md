We have preserved the mailing lists and their archives for future reference, should there be a need to recover past communications.

While we will maintain a mailing list for broad announcements, we will primarily utilize GitHub Discussions and Announcements to share updates with the Trilinos community.

If you have any questions, please feel free to post them in the comments on this GitHub [Discussion/Announcement](https://github.com/orgs/trilinos/discussions/14544).
