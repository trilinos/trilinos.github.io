The [main Trilinos git
repository](https://github.com/trilinos/trilinos.github.io) is on
GitHub at https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos.  Contributions can
be offered through the standard GitHub pull request model.  We
strongly encourage you to coordinate large contributions with the
Trilinos development team early in the process.  One way to do this
is to file a ticket in the GitHub issue tracking system prior to
any code development.  Additional detail on making contributions
can be found at [Contributing to
